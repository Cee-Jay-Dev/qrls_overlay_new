**How to install**
Step 1: Install node.js, IMPORTANT, don't do this, overlay won't work... (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
Step 2: Install fonts, ALSO IMPORTANT, open the folder font, double click all fonts and click the install button top left.
Step 3: IF you don't have SOS Relay, then copy the SOS.dll from bakkes_sos_plugin and paste it in AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins <- default path, if you've changed the install location, please put this in your bakkesmod plugins.
Step 4: Open StreamLabs OBS or OBS, whatever you use to stream, make a browser source, make sure that you set it to 1920x1080.
Step 5: Open Rocket League & Bakkesmod and then run start_overlay.bat by double clicking it.

Disclaimer: Do NOT touch any of the overlay files, if you touch it and break your stream, that's on you.
